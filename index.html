                <p>Listening to and playing music is a major part of my life.
                    I play both guitar and drums. While I don't consider myself an expert at either, people tell me i'm pretty good.
                    My favorite styles of music are metal, hard rock and hip hop.</p>

                <p>Another passion of mine is fitness. I love pushing myself in the gym. I believe working hard in the gym translates to
                    other aspects of life. The bodybuilding training style is what I prefer. I like sets with many reps at a weight that can be
                    controlled. LA Fitness Palm Harbor is the gym I attend.</p>
